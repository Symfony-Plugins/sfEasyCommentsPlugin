sfEasyCommentsPlugin
====================

Simple plugin to add comment forms on about anything. All you need to have is
something unique that determines what you're commenting. For example, it can be
a database object, or a documentation page name.

Once you found what context will determine your comments placeholder, just use:

    [php]
    <?php sfEasyCommentsHelper::render_for($myContext); ?>

You need to activate sfEasyComments module in your application's settings.yml
in order to use the plugin.

Since symfony 1.2, you also need to activate the plugin either in your
ProjectConfiguration or in one of your apps' configuration classes.
